This is an unofficial discord integration for razer chroma products.
Still in development.

## IMPORTANT
This application uses the discord RPC api which is currently whitelist only, that means that you cannot use this application without changing the discord client id.
(until discord allows me access to the RPC api)

## Features

- auto updates
- animations for discord notifications (more animations to come)
- once running you won't even notice that its there (your normal chroma profiles will be active until a discord event is received)

## How to install

~~Download installer from the releases page~~
builds will not work unless manually added to the whitelist by DELUUXE

## How to uninstall

Once installed it's in your programs list, you can uninstall it from there or go to appdata/local/programs/DiscordChroma and run the uninstaller
